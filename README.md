If you have any questions, feel free to create a issue or contact me via mastodon: [chaos.social/@TreeBug](https://chaos.social/@TreeBug). 


**Recommendations:**
- Create a Python 3.12 virtual environment (e.g. with Conda) before editing the notebook. 
- The models are kept small to minimize resource use, but LLM training is still resource-intensive. For better performance, use platforms like Google Colab if your local machine isnâ€™t sufficient.
